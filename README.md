# Design-of-Water-Delivery-Pipe-Network
##### The aim of this project was to analyze and design a water distribution system. It included the pipe flow principles and its applications in analyzing the water supply system. The general principles of water distribution system were covered to highlight cost aspects, and the parameters required to design the system. For this design, the pressure loss that the pipe network undergoes will be taken into consideration. 

##### The design consist of a solution algorithm/iterative process per the water distribution network system requirements that can be easily adopted by other engineers. A numerical code was developed, where its inputs are total supply flow rate, pipe lengths, and estimate minor loss coefficients, and its outputs are pressure field (Pi, i = 1 to 7, in Kpa gage), flow rates through main and branch pipes (Lit/min), and velocity field (m/sec). The following constraints/considertions were given for this project:
  * Each branch water is discharged to atmospheric pressure (Patm = 101.36 Kpa, zero gage pressure).
  * The system is positioned beneath a flat floors, so there is no change in height (Elevation)
  * Pipe sizes must be commercially available and no less than 0.5 inches
